      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Percy Jackson is a twelve‑year‑old boy who has been kicked out of multiple boarding schools and lately strange
        things have been happening: his teacher transforms into a monster, mythical creatures seem to appear out of
        nowhere and the ancient Greek gods might be real after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Percy discovers he is a demigod, the son of the sea god Poseidon, he is whisked away to a secret camp for
        kids like him. Soon, he learns that Zeus’s master lightning bolt has been stolen and Percy is the prime
        suspect. Together with his friends, he embarks on a dangerous quest across the United States to recover the
        bolt, confront monsters, gods and betrayal and prevent a war among the Olympians.
