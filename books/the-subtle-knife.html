      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Subtle Knife is the second book in the trio of novels of the series His Dark Materials. It continues the
        adventures of Lyra Silvertongue and introduces Will Parry — a 12‑year‑old boy from our world who stumbles into a
        parallel universe and becomes the bearer of a powerful, dimension‑ripping blade known as the Subtle Knife.
        Together, Lyra and Will journey across worlds, grappling with soul‑eating spectres, conspiracies of power and
        the search for truth about “Dust.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Darker and more complex than the first book, The Subtle Knife deepens the themes of identity, responsibility and
        destiny while expanding the story’s scope: multiple universes, metaphysical danger and a destiny that binds
        Lyra and Will across worlds.
