      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Disappearing Spoon tells the fascinating stories behind the elements of the periodic table, from their
        discovery to their dramatic impacts on history, science and human lives. The book weaves together quirky
        anecdotes, vivid historical accounts and unexpected science: gallium spoons that melt in hot tea; the bizarre
        fates of element discoverers; poison, war and scientific rivalries; and how each element has shaped everything
        from medicine to warfare.

      <p>
        Easy to read for non‑scientists, yet rich in detail and human drama, The Disappearing Spoon makes chemistry,
        and the history of science, thrilling. It reveals how the periodic table is not just a chart on a wall, but a
        cast of characters whose stories span love, obsession, madness, triumph and tragedy.
