        The story follows Winston Smith, a low‑ranking employee of the Ministry of Truth, whose job is to rewrite
        historical records to fit the Party’s propaganda. As Winston secretly rebels, through forbidden love with
        Julia, private thoughts and a longing for truth, he becomes entangled in the brutal mechanisms of control:
        surveillance, censorship, thought‑police, torture and reality manipulation.

        1984 remains a chilling and powerful warning about the dangers of totalitarianism, surveillance, propaganda and
        the loss of personal freedom. Its themes, manipulation of truth, control of language and history, erosion of
        individuality, remain deeply relevant decades after its publication. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
