      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Secret of the Old Clock is the very first book in the classic Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series. In this
        story, young sleuth Nancy Drew becomes involved in a suspicious inheritance, wealthy Josiah Crowley’s estate
        seems to have been willed to a greedy family, while some poorer but deserving heirs were ignored. Nancy uses her
        wit, courage and detective skills to search for a missing will and discovers that the key to the mystery lies
        hidden in an old clock. As she follows clues, questions wealthy suspects and uncovers secrets, Nancy works to
        ensure justice and that the rightful heirs receive what they are owed.

        With a mix of suspense, clever sleuthing and old‑fashioned charm, this book introduces readers to Nancy’s daring
        spirit and sense of justice, a classic detective adventure that has inspired generations of young readers.
