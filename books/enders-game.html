      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Ender's Game is a gripping science‑fiction novel set in a future where humanity, recovering from two devastating
        wars with an alien species known as the Formics (or “buggers”), scrambles to prepare for a feared third
        invasion. To build the next generation of commanders, gifted children are recruited and trained in an elite
        orbiting Battle School. Among them is Andrew “Ender” Wiggin, a boy whose tactical genius and psychological
        resilience set him apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Ender advances through increasingly difficult war games, including zero‑gravity battles and simulated fleet
        commands, he faces intense pressure, isolation and moral dilemmas. The novel explores themes of leadership, the
        ethics of war, innocence lost and what it means to be human in times of conflict.
