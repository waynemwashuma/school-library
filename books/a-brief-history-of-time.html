      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        A Brief History of Time explores the deepest questions about the universe, how it began, how it works and what
        its ultimate fate may be. Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking explains concepts like the Big Bang, black holes,
        the nature of space and time, quantum mechanics and the search for a unified theory, all in language
        accessible to non‑scientists.
      </p>

        Since its release, the book has become a landmark in science writing: it opened up complex cosmological ideas to
        a broad readership, inspiring generations of readers to look at the cosmos with
        wonder.
