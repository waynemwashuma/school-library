            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The Hound of the Baskervilles finds legendary detective Sherlock Holmes and his loyal companion Dr.
                Watson drawn into a chilling mystery centered around the Baskerville family, haunted by rumors of a
                monstrous spectral hound roaming the fog‑shrouded moors of Devon. After the sudden, mysterious death of
                Sir Charles Baskerville, Holmes is asked to protect his heir, Sir Henry, as the family’s ancestral curse
                threatens to claim another victim.
            </p>
            <p>
                Set against an eerie landscape of marshes, ancient manor houses and misty moorlands, the novel
                masterfully blends gothic horror and rational deduction. As Watson investigates on the ground, Holmes
                works behind the scenes, gradually peeling back layers of superstition, deceit and hidden identity to
                reveal a human culprit, not the supernatural beast many fear. The book remains one of the most beloved
                detective stories ever written.
