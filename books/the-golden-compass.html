      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Golden Compass is the first book in the His Dark Materials trilogy. The novel follows a 12‑year‑old girl
        named Lyra Silvertongue in a parallel world where every human has a “dæmon,” an animal representation of one’s soul.
        When children start disappearing under mysterious circumstances, Lyra embarks on a dangerous journey to the
        Arctic to rescue them, only to uncover a sinister conspiracy involving a mysterious substance known as “Dust.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Filled with bold imagination, moral complexity and breathtaking adventure, the story weaves exploration of
        freedom, power and innocence with a richly built alternate world, making The Golden Compass a modern fantasy
        classic.
