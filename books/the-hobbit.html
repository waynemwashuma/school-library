      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a peace‑loving hobbit from the Shire, who is swept into a grand
        adventure when wizard Gandalf and a band of dwarves invite him to help reclaim the dwarves’ homeland and
        treasure from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Along his journey across Middle‑earth, through forests, mountains,
        goblin caves and dragon‑guarded halls, Bilbo encounters trolls, goblins, giant spiders, elves and other
        dangers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of the quest, Bilbo transforms from a comfort‑loving homebody into a clever, courageous and
        resourceful adventurer. The book weaves together themes of bravery, friendship, personal growth and the clash
        between simple comfort and epic adventure, making The Hobbit a timeless classic of fantasy literature.
