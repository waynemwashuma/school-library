      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Girl Who Could Read Hearts tells the story of Kate Kindrick, a young girl born with a rare “seventh sense,”
        the ability to actually read human hearts and perceive their inner colors, emotions and hidden truths. As Kate
        grows up, she struggles with skepticism, misunderstanding from family members and the challenge of
        distinguishing between ordinary reality and the mystical visions that come with her gift.

        When tragedy strikes and Kate ignores inner warnings from her gift and her guardian angel doll, her life and
        that of her loved ones, spirals into danger. Throughout the turmoil, Kate learns about faith, intuition, the
        power of trust and how to navigate a world where what is seen isn’t always the whole truth. The novel blends
        spiritual themes, family drama and a journey of self‑acceptance, making it a touching story about inner gifts,
        hope and healing.
