      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful coming‑of‑age novel set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during
        the Great Depression. The story is narrated by young Scout Finch, whose father, lawyer Atticus Finch, defends
        Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Through Scout’s growing awareness, the novel
        confronts issues of racial injustice, moral integrity, innocence and empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Praised for its sensitive and honest portrayal of prejudice, conscience and childhood innocence lost too soon,
        the book weaves warmth, moral courage and social critique, showing how compassion and understanding can
        challenge deep‑rooted injustice even in a flawed society.
